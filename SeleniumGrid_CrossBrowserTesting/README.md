# Selenium Grid Architecture
1. Client Request: The client sends a request to the Router.
2. Router: The Router forwards the request to the Distributor.
3. Distributor:
   If a new session is needed, the Distributor creates a session ID.
   If there are multiple sessions, the Session Queue holds the requests until the Distributor can process them.
   If itâ€™s the first time the test is being executed, the Distributor creates a Session Map and sends it to the Router. The Router then directs the request to a suitable Node.
   If the Session Map already exists, the Distributor sends the request directly to the appropriate Node.
5. Event Bus: Facilitates communication between different components of Selenium Grid through event channels.
# Setting Up Selenium Grid
# On the Hub Machine
1. Download Selenium Server: Obtain the Selenium server JAR file from the official Selenium website.
2. Place Files: Ensure the Selenium server JAR file and browser drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver for Firefox, EdgeDriver) are in the same folder.
3. Open Command Prompt: Navigate to the folder containing the Selenium server JAR and drivers.
4. Start Hub: Run the following command to start the Hub: java -jar selenium-server-4.23.0.jar hub

# On the Node Machine
1. Download Selenium Server: As with the Hub, download the Selenium server JAR file and place it in a folder.
2. Place Drivers: Ensure the browser drivers are also placed in the same folder as the Selenium server JAR.
3. Open Command Prompt: Navigate to the folder containing the Selenium server JAR and drivers.
4. Start Node: Run the following command to start the Node and connect it to the Hub: java -jar selenium-server-4.23.0.jar node --detect-drivers true --publish-events tcp://<HUB_IP>:4442 --subscribe-events tcp://<HUB_IP>:4443
5. Replace <HUB_IP> with the IP address of the Hub machine.
# Obtain Hub Details:
IP Address: Find the IP address of the Hub machine. For example, 192.168.0.105.
XPUB Port: 4442
XSUB Port: 4443
# Example Command for Node
If your Hub machine's IP address is 192.168.0.105, you would use: java -jar selenium-server-4.23.0.jar node --detect-drivers true --publish-events tcp://192.168.0.105:4442 --subscribe-events tcp://192.168.0.105:4443

By following these steps, you should have a functional Selenium Grid setup with a Hub managing and distributing test requests to Nodes across different machines.
This setup enables parallel test execution across various browsers and platforms, enhancing testing efficiency and reducing cycle times.
